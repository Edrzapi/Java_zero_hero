/**
 * Entry point for the basics module.
 * Demonstrates Java's most fundamental building blocks: output, variables, type inference.
 *
 * Original Main.java (source repo) contained three issues fixed here:
 *   1. A public static String field mutated by every method call — global mutable state is an anti-pattern.
 *      Each method should use local scope or accept parameters.
 *   2. System.out.printf("%s %s this is the ans") with no arguments supplied — throws
 *      MissingFormatArgumentException at runtime. Always match format specifiers to arguments.
 *   3. Cross-domain coupling: it imported ConditionsExtended (control flow) into a basics class.
 *      Each domain should be independently runnable.
