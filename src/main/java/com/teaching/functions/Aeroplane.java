/**
 * Demonstrates constructor chaining using this(...).
 * Every constructor delegates to the most complete one — avoids duplicating initialisation logic.
 *
 * Fix applied: removed 'import javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthOptionPaneUI' — a dead import
 * from a Swing UI library with no relevance to this class.
 *
 * Also removed 'public int count' that was incremented in the constructor.
 * As an instance field it counted nothing useful (each object has its own copy starting at 0,
 * incremented to 1, then never read). A static counter would track instance count;
 * that pattern is covered in the static fields module.
