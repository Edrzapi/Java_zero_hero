/**
 * DAO (Data Access Object) interface for the 'students' table.
 *
 * Why an interface?
 *   — Decouples the caller from the JDBC implementation.
 *   — In tests you can swap in an in-memory List-backed fake without any SQL.
 *   — In production you could swap the H2 impl for a MySQL, PostgreSQL, or
 *     JPA-backed impl with zero changes to the callers.
 *
 * All methods declare throws SQLException because JDBC is a checked-exception API.
 * The caller (JdbcRunner) decides how to handle or re-throw.
