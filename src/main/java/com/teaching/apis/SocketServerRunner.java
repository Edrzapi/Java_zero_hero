/**
 * Minimal TCP echo server — accepts one client, echoes every line back, then shuts down.
 *
 * HOW TO RUN (requires two terminals):
 *   Terminal 1: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.teaching.apis.SocketServerRunner"
 *   Terminal 2: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.teaching.apis.SocketClientRunner"
 *
 * For a self-contained single-JVM demo (server on a background thread), see the
 * concurrency module — that pattern is shown in ThreadRunner after Executors are introduced.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 *   ServerSocket — binds to a port; holds a backlog queue of incoming connections
 *   accept()     — blocks the calling thread until a client connects; returns a Socket
 *   Socket       — bidirectional channel; has an InputStream (reads) and OutputStream (writes)
