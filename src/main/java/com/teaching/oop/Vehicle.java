/**
 * Base class for the Vehicle hierarchy.
 * Demonstrates inheritance: Car extends Vehicle and inherits noOfWheels and describe().
 *
 * Fix applied from source repo:
 *   The original only had Vehicle(int noOfWheels). Car() called super() which
 *   resolved to the no-arg constructor — which did not exist — causing a compile error.
 *   Fixed by adding a no-arg constructor that delegates to the parameterised one.
