/**
 * A plain student model class demonstrating encapsulation: private fields, a constructor,
 * getters, and a meaningful toString().
 *
 * Fully rewritten from source repo (teaching moment / anti-pattern corrected):
 *   The original Student extended Shape, which required implementing getArea() returning 0.
 *   Student is not a geometric shape — this was a live coding mistake where the wrong
 *   base class was selected. Correct approach: Student is an independent class with
 *   its own relevant fields (name, age, grade).
